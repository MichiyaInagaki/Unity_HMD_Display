"Shouwa" 80's Japanese town model set
vol.3 -Mall

This is a model set of Japanese style architectural style.

In this vol.3, models of shopping districts - individual management stores and buildings of SMEs are bundled.

This series is very familiar to Japanese people
We are planning to provide models that can express the landscape of Japan with the characteristics of the late Shouwa era (1970-1980).

This is an adjustment assuming medium / small scale development for PC.
It does not include complicated gimmicks, it targets low polygons, high versatility, easy to use.


We prepare a sample scene that can be used immediately, a large number of build elements and general purpose material.

Since commercial facilities require a huge variety of objects, we have made a way to reduce the unique texture and use general-purpose materials as much as possible without putting pressure on resources.


The model included in the package,

Commercial building with indoor
No indoor building
Store where renovated private houses
Tiny store
1f store
In-store Prop
Ducts · pipes · windows · doors
Signs / leaflets
Arcade roof
Advertisement


It includes a replacement material that can change appearance.

Types of buildings, shops and signs, plops in the store will be increased with future updates.

Several sample models of other series are also included in this asset.

** Usage Tips **

In many buildings, the first floor part is vacant. By fitting the shop and the indoor model, you can make it into a custom building.

There are several buildings and parts that can fill the gaps between the arranged buildings without discomfort.
By making it close, you can make it a long building.

Some of the signs are reversible. This is a purpose of reducing the number of materials and the number of objects.
Likewise, the site parts with slopes can be used as flat grounds by turning the top and bottom upside down


* sample Post-Processing Profile.asset is a setting file for post processing stack.

* BTAStandardDSZF1.0.shader is a custom shader that added Z fighting countermeasure and duplex display to Standard Shader. I think that the post effect can be applied without problems
